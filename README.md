- Selction 
- Bubble
- Insertion
- Merge
- Quick
- Counting
- Heap
- Radix 
- Cocktail

## Learning Objectives

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
